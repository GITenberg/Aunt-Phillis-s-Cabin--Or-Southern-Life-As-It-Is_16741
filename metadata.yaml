description: "Aunt Phillis's Cabin; or, Southern Life As It Is by Mary Henderson Eastman\
  \ is a plantation fiction novel, and is perhaps the most read anti-Tom novel in\
  \ American literature. It was published by Lippincott, Grambo & Co. of Philadelphia\
  \ in 1852 as a response to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, published\
  \ earlier that year. The novel sold 20,000â€“30,000 copies, making it a strong commercial\
  \ success and bestseller. Based on her growing up in Warrenton, Virginia of an elite\
  \ planter family, Eastman portrays plantation owners and slaves as mutually respectful,\
  \ kind, and happy beings.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
